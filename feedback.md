/Users/raphaelcastro/Documents/programming/rune/docs/dist.rune/polymorphic/provider/shared/mod_test.ts
just assert that the class exists.

/Users/raphaelcastro/Documents/programming/rune/docs/dist.rune/polymorphic/provider/implementations/genie/mod.ts
the method name is just search not provider search

you can determine wether a polymoriphi class folder is pure or impure if any method contained in any class
has a boundry os: fs: etc.. any of those tags

why does /Users/raphaelcastro/Documents/programming/rune/docs/dist.rune/impure/provider exist if
/Users/raphaelcastro/Documents/programming/rune/docs/dist.rune/polymorphic/provider exists?
