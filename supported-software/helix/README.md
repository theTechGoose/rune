# Helix Icon Support

Helix is a terminal-based editor and uses your terminal's font for displaying icons. If your terminal font supports Unicode Runic characters or Nerd Fonts, the Rune icon (ᚱ) will display correctly.

Recommended fonts with Rune character support:
- Any Nerd Font variant (e.g., JetBrainsMono Nerd Font)
- Fira Code
- Source Code Pro

The syntax highlighting and LSP support are configured via `rune install --editor helix`.
