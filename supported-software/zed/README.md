# Zed Icon Support

Zed currently uses system fonts for file icons in the file tree. The Rune icon (ᚱ) will display if your system font supports Unicode Runic characters.

For custom file type icons, Zed would need an icon theme extension, which is not yet widely supported.

The syntax highlighting and LSP support are configured via `rune install --editor zed`.
